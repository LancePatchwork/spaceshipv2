# Starship Simulator - Game Concept Brainstorming

## Core Concept
A realistic starship simulator where you start as a frigate captain and rise through the ranks in a turbulent universe. Think Distant Worlds but with direct ship command, crew management, and strategic combat. The game emphasizes realistic time-based operations, crew skills, and meaningful choices that affect your ship's performance and crew morale.

## Gameplay Pillars

### 1. Realistic Time-Based Operations
- Orders take time to execute - no instant actions
- Crew must physically move to stations and perform tasks
- Ship systems require time to power up/down
