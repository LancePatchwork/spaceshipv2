# M08 — Crew & Progression — v1 (Frozen)

## Skill Scale
- Skills are **1–100**. **Ace** at **80+**; **90–100** unlocks elite perks (post‑MVP tuning).
- XP gain has **diminishing returns**: effective XP = rawXP × (1 − skill/100). Minimum **5%** always applies.

## XP Source
- **Event‑resolved** only (M02). When a task completes, involved roles gain XP.
- Long tasks auto‑reschedule (e.g., refining 1h cycles).

## Time Quantum
- We process XP in **30‑minute blocks** to minimize event churn.

## Baselines (per person)
- **Peaceful training/work:** ~ **1 XP/day** total for relevant skills.
- **Combat stress modifier:** **×5** for blocks where a hostile contact is in **combat range** (≈ 2× max weapon range) or engagement happened within last 30 min.
- All **modifiers** applied at **event resolution** time.

## Multi‑Department Crew
- A crewmember can hold multiple **non‑conflicting** roles with a **priority list** (e.g., Engineering > Sensors). The event queue drives re‑tasking.

## No HP, Maintenance‑Driven
- Modules have **maintenance level**; damage increases maintenance load. Repairs can only restore up to a soft cap; full refurb/replacement needed beyond that.
